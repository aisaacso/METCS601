				Children Martial Arts

				At what age can children start?

				Our experience has shown that children ages four and up will be able to take the greatest advantage from Tae Kwon Do classes. Starting at age four, your child can participate in our trial lesson program, which allows our instructors to work with them one on one and evaluate their readiness for group classes. Our staff will then use their experience to recommend the best course of action for you and your child.

				Your child will:

				Become more fit, energetic, and active

				Learn the importance of treating others with respect

				Learn the value of self-control and the power of cooperation

				Gain the ability to set and achieve goals

				Learn to persevere and not give up when faced with challenges

				As a student of Taekwondo, your child will experience more than just self-defense. They will experience self-improvement. Virtually every area of their life can be affected in a positive way through Taekwondo training. Taekwondo will improve your child’s fitness, increase their self-esteem, and sharpen their focus in such a powerful way that it will benefit them throughout their life.

				Taekwondo is great for physical fitness:

				Students enjoy training Taekwondo for years, not months. Every class is a complete workout designed to improve your flexibility, balance, endurance and strength. With regular training you will lose weight, gain muscle tone and improve your athletic performance for other sports.

				Taekwondo is perfect for:

				Helping young children to develop coordination and balance

				Motivating sedentary children to participate in exercise

				Enhancing the strength of children with physical challenges

				Providing athletic children a way to become even more fit

				Our enthusiastic instructors and high-energy classroom make getting in shape fun and rewarding. Your child will look forward to coming to class and will want to attend regularly.

				Children improve listening skills, concentration, and grades

				Teachers and parents alike often notice a dramatic difference in children who study the martial arts. Teaching kids to stay focused is one of our specialties and the results are noticeable. Children listen better at home, handle homework and chores more efficiently, put more focus and effort into schoolwork, and receive better grades.

				Does Taekwondo increase aggressiveness?

				Absolutely not. Your child will be taught from the first lesson that true "Tae Kwon Do kids" never misuse their martial arts skills. Throughout their training, they will be reminded that being physically and mentally tough does not allow one to be tough with others. Instead, Tae Kwon Do students are expected to be humble, courteous, respectful and careful about when and where they practice their skills. The instructors at Master Chong's will continually educate your child that Tae Kwon Do is a form of exercise and self improvement, not a tool for bullying.

				The focus gained at Taekwondo will:

				Help hyper-active kids to settle down

				Give children with Attention Deficit Disorder better concentration skills

				Enable students to improve their memory and study habits

				Boost Self-Esteem and Confidence

				Taekwondo will provide your child the challenges and the tools to overcome them. Using praise and positive feedback, our instructors encourage students and motivate effort. Our belt system gives students mini-goals to strive for and teaches kids the power of goal-setting.

				The self-confidence gained in Taekwondo will enable your child to:

				Overcome shyness

				Resist negative peer pressure

				Stand up to bullies and speak up for themselves

				Raise their hand in school and volunteer their opinion

				Be more comfortable with meeting new people

				How safe is it to learn?

				Tae Kwon Do is safe and fun for students of all ages and physical abilities. Classes are taught by expert instructors as students are shown techniques in a step-by-step manner at their own pace. A thorough stretching routine, matted flooring, and protective safety equipment are all part of our commitment to ensuring student safety.

				Our instructors make the difference:

				Our instructors are experts at working with children. They know how to gain your child’s attention and keep them motivated by setting realistic step-by-step goals and encouraging them every step of the way. Every member of our staff will take a personal interest in your child and be committed to helping them achieve their potential. We also take it as a priority to serve as good role models. You can be assured that we will demonstrate the respect and character that we would like our students to embody. Our staff are patient, enthusiastic, and teach with a smile! We love what we do and are sure that you and your family will feel that in the classroom.
